Integrations
============

The Raven Python module also comes with integration for some commonly used
libraries to automatically capture errors from common environments.  This
means that once you have such an integration configured you typically do
not need to report errors manually.

Some integrations allow specifying these in a standard configuration,
otherwise they are generally passed upon instantiation of the Sentry
client.
