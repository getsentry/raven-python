Configuring ``WSGI`` Middleware
===============================

Raven includes a simple to use WSGI middleware.

::

    from raven import Client
    from raven.middleware import Sentry

    application = Sentry(
        application,
        Client('http://public:secret@example.com/1')
    )

.. note:: Many frameworks will not propagate exceptions to the underlying WSGI middleware by default.
