Basic Usage
===========

This gives a basic overview of how to use the raven client with Python
directly.

Capture an Error
----------------

The most basic use for raven is to record one specific error that occurs::

    from raven import Client

    client = Client('___DSN___')

    try:
        1 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        client.captureException()

Reporting an Event
------------------

To report an arbitrary event you can use the
:py:meth:`~raven.Client.capture` method.  This is the most low-level
method available.  In most cases you would want to use the
:py:meth:`~raven.Client.captureMessage` method instead however which
directly reports a message::

    client.captureMessage('Something went fundamentally wrong')


Adding Context
--------------

The raven client internally keeps a thread local mapping that can carry
additional information.  Whenever a message is submitted to Sentry that
additional data will be passed along.

For instance if you use a web framework, you can use this to inject
additional information into the context.  The basic primitive for this is
the :py:attr:`~raven.Client.context` attribute.  It provides a `merge()`
and `clear()` function that can be used::

    def handle_request(request):
        client.context.merge({'user': {
            'email': request.user.email
        }})
        try:
            ...
        finally:
            client.context.clear()

Additionally starting with Raven 5.14 you can bind the context to the
current thread to enable crumb support by calling `activate()`.  The
deactivation happens upon calling `clear()`.  This can also be achieved by
using the context object with the `with` statement.  This is needed to
enable breadcrumb capturing.  Framework integrations typically do this
automatically.

These two examples are equivalent::

    def handle_request(request):
        client.context.activate()
        client.context.merge({'user': {
            'email': request.user.email
        }})
        try:
            ...
        finally:
            client.context.clear()

With a context manager::

    def handle_request(request):
        with client.context:
            client.context.merge({'user': {
                'email': request.user.email
            }})
            try:
                ...
            finally:
                client.context.clear()

Testing the Client
------------------

Once you've got your server configured, you can test the Raven client by
using its CLI::

    raven test ___DSN___

If you've configured your environment to have ``SENTRY_DSN`` available, you
can simply drop the optional DSN argument::

    raven test

You should get something like the following, assuming you're configured everything correctly::

    $ raven test sync+___DSN___
    Using DSN configuration:
      sync+___DSN___

    Client configuration:
      servers        : ___API_URL___/api/store/
      project        : ___PROJECT_ID___
      public_key     : ___PUBLIC_KEY___
      secret_key     : ___SECRET_KEY___

    Sending a test message... success!
