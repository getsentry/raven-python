--------------

* Improved fix for the Django middleware regression.

Version 5.30.0
--------------

* Keep the original type for the django middleware settings if we
  change them.

Version 5.29.0
--------------

* Added `register_logging_handler`.
* Removed bad mixin from django's WSGI middleware
* Removed "support for extracing data from rest_framework" because
  this broke code.

Version 5.28.0
--------------

* Corrected an issue that caused `close()` on WSGI iterables to not be
  correctly called.
* Fixes the new Django 1.10 `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` warning.

Version 5.27.0
--------------

Version 5.26.0
--------------

* Fixed potential concurrency issue with event IDs in the Flask integration.
* Added a workaround for leakage when broken WSGI middlware or servers are
  used that do not call `close()` on the iterat.r

Version 5.25.0

* Prevent chained exception recursion
* In environments which look like AWS Lambda or Google App Engine utilize the
  synchronous transport.
* Added Celery config option to ignore expected exceptions

Version 5.24.0
--------------

* Added support for Django 1.10.

Version 5.21.0
--------------

* Add formatted attribute to message events
* Fill in empty filename if django fails to give one for
  template information on newer Django versions with disabled
  debug mode.

Version 5.20.0
--------------

* fixed an error that could cause certain SQL queries to fail to
  record as breadcrumbs if no parameters were supplied.

Version 5.19.0
--------------

* remove duration from SQL query breadcrumbs. This was not rendered
  in the UI and will come back in future versions of Sentry with a
  different interface.
* resolved a bug that caused crumbs to be recorded incorrectly.

Version 5.18.0
--------------

* Breadcrumbs are now attempted to be deduplicated to catch some common
  cases where log messages just spam up the breadcrumbs.
* Improvements to the public breadcrumbs API and stabilized some.
* Automatically activate the context on calls to `merge`

Version 5.17.0
--------------

* if breadcrumbs fail to process due to an error they are now skipped.

--------------

  disabling of breadcrumbs quickly.
* corrected an issue where python interpreters with bytecode writing enabled
  would report incorrect logging locations when breadcrumb patching for
  logging was enabled.

Version 5.15.0
--------------

* Improve thread binding for the context.  This makes the main thread never
  deactivate the client automatically on clear which means that more code
  should automatically support breadcrumbs without changes.

Version 5.14.0
--------------

* Added support for reading git sha's from packed references.
* Detect disabled thread support for uwsgi.
* Added preliminary support for breadcrumbs.

Note: this version adds breadcrumbs to events.  This means that if you run a
Sentry version older than 8.5 you will see some warnings in the UI.  Consider
using an older version of the client if you do not want to see it.

--------------

* The raven client supports the stacktrace to be absent.  This improves support
  with celery and multiprocessing.

Version 5.11.0
--------------

* ``Client.configure_logging`` has been removed, and handlers will not automatically
  be added to 'sentry' and 'raven' namespaces.
* Improved double error check
* Restored support for exc_info is True.

Version 5.10.2
--------------

* Remember exceptions in flight until the context is cleared so that two
  reports with the same exception data do not result in two errors
  being logged.
* Allow logging exclusions.

Version 5.10.1
--------------

* Fixed a problem where bytes as keys in dictionaries caused problems
  on data sanitization if those bytes were outside of the ASCII range.

version 3 of the protocol.

Support includes:

* Sending 'python' as the platform.
* The 'tags' option (on all constructors that support options).
* Updated authentication header.

Additionally, the following has changed:

* Configuring the client with an empty DSN value will disable sending of messages.

* ``Client.create_from_text`` and ``Client.create_from_exception`` have been removed.
* ``Client.message`` and ``Client.exception`` have been removed.
* The ``key`` setting has been removed.

* The ``register_signals`` option in RAVEN_CONFIG (Django) is no longer used.
* A new helper, ``Client.context()`` is now available for scoping options.
* ``Client.captureExceptions`` is now deprecated in favor of ``Client.context``.
* Credit card values will now be sanitized with the default processors.
* A new eventlet+http transport exists.
* A new threaded+http transport exists.
* PyPy is now supported.
* Django 1.5 should now be supported (experimental).
* Gevent 1.0 should now be supported (experimental).
* Python 2.5 is no longer supported.
* [Django] The ``skip_sentry`` attribute is no longer supported. A new option config option has replaced this: ``SENTRY_IGNORE_EXCEPTIONS``.

Version 2.0.0
-------------

* New serializers exist (and can be registered) against Raven. See ``raven.utils.serializer`` for more information.
* You can now pass ``tags`` to the ``capture`` method. This will require a Sentry server compatible with the new
  tags protocol.
* A new gevent+http transport exists.
* A new tornado+http transport exists.
* A new twisted+http transport exists.
* Zope integration has been added. See docs for more information.
* PasteDeploy integration has been added. See docs for more information.
* A Django endpoint now exists for proxying requests to Sentry. See ``raven.contrib.django.views`` for more information.

Version 1.9.0
-------------

* Signatures are no longer sent with messages. This requires the server version to be at least 4.4.6.
* Several fixes and additions were added to the Django report view.
* ``long`` types are now handled in transform().
* Improved integration with Celery (and django-celery) for capturing errors.

Version 1.8.0
-------------

* There is now a builtin view as part of the Django integration for sending events server-side
  (from the client) to Sentry. The view is currently undocumented, but is available as ``{% url raven-report %}``
  and will use your server side credentials. To use this view you'd simply swap out the servers configuration in
  raven-js and point it to the given URL.
* A new middleware for ZeroRPC now exists.
* A new protocol for registering transports now exists.
* Corrected some behavior in the UDP transport.
* Celery signals are now connected by default within the Django integration.

Version 1.7.0
-------------

* The password sanitizer will now attempt to sanitize key=value pairs within strings (such as the querystring).
* Two new santiziers were added: RemoveStackLocalsProcessor and RemovePostDataProcessor

Version 1.6.0
-------------

* Stacks must now be passed as a list of tuples (frame, lineno) rather than a list of frames. This
  includes calls to logging (extra={'stack': []}), as well as explicit client calls (capture(stack=[])).

  This corrects some issues (mostly in tracebacks) with the wrong lineno being reported for a frame.

Version 1.4.0
-------------

* Raven now tracks the state of the Sentry server. If it receives an error, it will slow down
  requests to the server (by passing them into a named logger, sentry.errors), and increasingly
  delay the next try with repeated failures, up to about a minute.

Version 1.3.6
-------------

* gunicorn is now disabled in default logging configuration
