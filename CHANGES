2.0.0

* New serializers exist (and can be registered) against Raven. See ``raven.utils.serializer`` for more information.
* You can now pass ``tags`` to the ``capture`` method. This will require a Sentry server compatible with the new
  tags protocol.
* A new gevent+http transport exists.
* A new tornado+http transport exists.
* A new twisted+http transport exists.
* Zope integration has been added. See docs for more information.
* PasteDeploy integration has been added. See docs for more information.
* A Django endpoint now exists for proxying requests to Sentry. See ``raven.contrib.django.views`` for more information.

1.9.0

* Signatures are no longer sent with messages. This requires the server version to be at least 4.4.6.
* Several fixes and additions were added to the Django report view.
* ``long`` types are now handled in transform().
* Improved integration with Celery (and django-celery) for capturing errors.

1.8.0

* There is now a builtin view as part of the Django integration for sending events server-side
  (from the client) to Sentry. The view is currently undocumented, but is available as ``{% url raven-report %}``
  and will use your server side credentials. To use this view you'd simply swap out the servers configuration in
  raven-js and point it to the given URL.
* A new middleware for ZeroRPC now exists.
* A new protocol for registering transports now exists.
* Corrected some behavior in the UDP transport.
* Celery signals are now connected by default within the Django integration.

1.7.0

* The password sanitizer will now attempt to sanitize key=value pairs within strings (such as the querystring).
* Two new santiziers were added: RemoveStackLocalsProcessor and RemovePostDataProcessor

1.6.0

* Stacks must now be passed as a list of tuples (frame, lineno) rather than a list of frames. This
  includes calls to logging (extra={'stack': []}), as well as explicit client calls (capture(stack=[])).

  This corrects some issues (mostly in tracebacks) with the wrong lineno being reported for a frame.

1.4.0

* Raven now tracks the state of the Sentry server. If it receives an error, it will slow down
  requests to the server (by passing them into a named logger, sentry.errors), and increasingly
  delay the next try with repeated failures, up to about a minute.

1.3.6

* gunicorn is now disabled in default logging configuration

1.3.5

* Moved exception and message methods to capture{Exception,Message}.
* Added captureQuery method.

1.3.4

* Corrected duplicate DSN behavior in Django client.

1.3.3

* Django can now be configured by setting SENTRY_DSN.
* Improve logging for send_remote failures (and correct issue created when
  send_encoded was introduced).
* Renamed SantizePassworsProcessor to SanitizePassworsProcessor.

1.3.2

* Support sending the culprit with logging messages as part of extra.

1.3.1

* Added client.exception and client.message shortcuts.

1.3.0

* Refactored client send API to be more easily extensible.
* MOAR TESTS!

1.2.2

* Gracefully handle exceptions in Django client when using integrated
  setup.
* Added Client.error_logger as a new logger instance that points to
  ``sentry.errors``.

1.2.1

* Corrected behavior with raven logging errors to send_remote
  which could potentially cause a very large backlog to Sentry
  when it should just log to ``sentry.errors``.
* Ensure the ``site`` argument is sent to the server.

1.2.0

* Made DSN a first-class citizen throughout Raven.
* Added a Pylons-specific WSGI middleware.
* Improved the generic WSGI middleware to capture HTTP information.
* Improved logging and logbook handlers.

1.1.6

* Corrected logging stack behavior so that it doesnt capture raven+logging
  extensions are part of the frames.

1.1.5

* Remove logging attr magic.

1.1.4

* Correct encoding behavior on bool and float types.

1.1.3

* Fix 'request' attribute on Django logging.

1.1.2

* Corrected logging behavior with extra data to match pre 1.x behavior.

1.1.1

* Handle frames that are missing f_globals and f_locals.
* Stricter conversion of int and boolean values.
* Handle invalid sources for templates in Django.

1.1.0

* varmap was refactored to send keys back to callbacks.
* SanitizePasswordProcessor now handles http data.

1.0.5

* Renaming raven2 to raven as it causes too many issues.

1.0.4

* Corrected a bug in setup_logging.
* Raven now sends "sentry_version" header which is the expected
  server version.

1.0.3

* Handle more edge cases on stack iteration.

1.0.2

* Gracefully handle invalid f_locals.

1.0.1

* All datetimes are assumed to be utcnow() as of Sentry 2.0.0-RC5

1.0.0

* Now only works with Sentry>=2.0.0 server.
* Raven is now listed as raven2 on PyPi.

0.8.0

* raven.contrib.celery is now useable.
* raven.contrib.django.celery is now useable.
* Fixed a bug with request.raw_post_data buffering in Django.

0.7.1

* Servers would stop iterating after the first successful post which was not the
  intended behavior.

0.7.0

* You can now explicitly pass a list of frame objects to the process method.

0.6.1

* The default logging handler (SentryHandler) will now accept a set of kwargs to instantiate
  a new client with (GH-10).
* Fixed a bug with checksum generation when module or function were missing (GH-9).

0.6

* Added a Django-specific WSGI middleware.

0.5.1

* added Client.get_ident
