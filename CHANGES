Version 5.30.0
--------------

  change them.

Version 5.29.0

  record as breadcrumbs if no parameters were supplied.

Version 5.19.0
--------------

* remove duration from SQL query breadcrumbs. This was not rendered
  in the UI and will come back in future versions of Sentry with a
  different interface.

--------------

* Breadcrumbs are now attempted to be deduplicated to catch some common
  cases where log messages just spam up the breadcrumbs.

Note: this version adds breadcrumbs to events.  This means that if you run a

  be added to 'sentry' and 'raven' namespaces.
* Improved double error check

  reports with the same exception data do not result in two errors
  being logged.

version 3 of the protocol.

Support includes:

* Sending 'python' as the platform.
* The 'tags' option (on all constructors that support options).
* Updated authentication header.

Additionally, the following has changed:

* Configuring the client with an empty DSN value will disable sending of messages.

* ``Client.message`` and ``Client.exception`` have been removed.
* The ``key`` setting has been removed.

* The ``register_signals`` option in RAVEN_CONFIG (Django) is no longer used.
* A new helper, ``Client.context()`` is now available for scoping options.
* ``Client.captureExceptions`` is now deprecated in favor of ``Client.context``.
* Credit card values will now be sanitized with the default processors.
* A new eventlet+http transport exists.
* A new threaded+http transport exists.
* PyPy is now supported.
* Django 1.5 should now be supported (experimental).
* Gevent 1.0 should now be supported (experimental).
* Python 2.5 is no longer supported.
* [Django] The ``skip_sentry`` attribute is no longer supported. A new option config option has replaced this: ``SENTRY_IGNORE_EXCEPTIONS``.

Version 2.0.0
-------------

* New serializers exist (and can be registered) against Raven. See ``raven.utils.serializer`` for more information.
* You can now pass ``tags`` to the ``capture`` method. This will require a Sentry server compatible with the new
  tags protocol.
* A new gevent+http transport exists.
* A new tornado+http transport exists.
* A new twisted+http transport exists.
* Zope integration has been added. See docs for more information.
* PasteDeploy integration has been added. See docs for more information.
* A Django endpoint now exists for proxying requests to Sentry. See ``raven.contrib.django.views`` for more information.

Version 1.9.0
-------------

* Signatures are no longer sent with messages. This requires the server version to be at least 4.4.6.
* Several fixes and additions were added to the Django report view.
* ``long`` types are now handled in transform().
* Improved integration with Celery (and django-celery) for capturing errors.

Version 1.8.0
-------------

* There is now a builtin view as part of the Django integration for sending events server-side
  (from the client) to Sentry. The view is currently undocumented, but is available as ``{% url raven-report %}``
  and will use your server side credentials. To use this view you'd simply swap out the servers configuration in
  raven-js and point it to the given URL.
* A new middleware for ZeroRPC now exists.
* A new protocol for registering transports now exists.
* Corrected some behavior in the UDP transport.
* Celery signals are now connected by default within the Django integration.

Version 1.7.0
-------------

* Two new santiziers were added: RemoveStackLocalsProcessor and RemovePostDataProcessor

Version 1.6.0
-------------

* Stacks must now be passed as a list of tuples (frame, lineno) rather than a list of frames. This
  includes calls to logging (extra={'stack': []}), as well as explicit client calls (capture(stack=[])).

  This corrects some issues (mostly in tracebacks) with the wrong lineno being reported for a frame.

Version 1.4.0
-------------

* Raven now tracks the state of the Sentry server. If it receives an error, it will slow down
  requests to the server (by passing them into a named logger, sentry.errors), and increasingly
  delay the next try with repeated failures, up to about a minute.

Version 1.3.6
-------------

* gunicorn is now disabled in default logging configuration
